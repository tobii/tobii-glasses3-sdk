<p>10.1 <b>Confidential Information</b>. "Confidential

confidential or proprietary information of the Party, in written, graphic,
machine readable or other tangible form (including, without limitation,
research, product plans, products, services, the presence of this Agreement,
equipment, customers, markets, software, inventions, discoveries, ideas,
processes, designs, drawings, formulations, specifications, product
configuration information, marketing and finance documents, prototypes,
samples, data sets, and equipment, including all information not generally
known to the public and the terms of this Agreement. </p>

<p>10.2 <b>Confidentiality Undertaking</b>. All Confidential Information relating to a Party
will be held in confidence by the other Party to the same extent and with at
least the same degree of care as such Party protects its own confidential or
proprietary information of like kind and import, but in no event using less
than a reasonable degree of care. Neither Party may disclose, reverse
engineer, duplicate, publish, release, transfer, or otherwise make available
Confidential Information of the other Party in any form to, or for the use or
benefit of, any person or entity without the other Party’s prior written
consent. Each is entitled to disclose relevant aspects of the other Party’s
Confidential Information to its officers, directors, employees, agents and
subcontractors to the extent that the disclosure is reasonably necessary for
the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
disclosure is not prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. Each Party
will establish commercially reasonable controls to ensure the confidentiality
of the Confidential Information and to ensure that the Confidential Information
is not disclosed contrary to the provisions of this Agreement and applicable
privacy laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party will,
at a minimum, implement technical, administrative and physical measures as are
necessary to: (a) ensure the security and confidentiality of the Confidential
Information; (b) protect against any threats or hazards to the security
and integrity of the Confidential Information; and (c) protect against any
unauthorized access to or use of the Confidential Information. If a Party
delegates any duties and responsibilities under this Agreement to an agent or
other subcontractor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Party
will ensure that its agents and subcontractors adhere to the same requirements
as the Party is required to comply with under this Agreement.</p>

<p>10.3 The obligations in
Section 10.2 do not restrict any disclosure by either Party
<p class="indent1"> (a) pursuant to any applicable law or by order of any court or government
agency (provided that the disclosing Party gives prompt notice to the non-disclosing
Party of the order and cooperates, at the disclosing Party’s expense in any
effort to comply with or to contest the order), or (b) to either Party’s
accountants, legal advisors, auditors, and financial advisors. Further, the
obligations in Section 10.2 do not apply to information that is:
</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) developed by the other Party without reference to the disclosing
Party’s Confidential Information or without violating the disclosing Party’s
Intellectual Property Rights, </p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) or becomes publicly known (other than through
unauthorized disclosure), </p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) disclosed to, or learned by, the recipient
from a third party free of any obligation of confidentiality, and </p>
<p class="indent2">(iv) already known by such Party without an obligation of confidentiality
other than pursuant to this Agreement or any confidentiality agreements entered
into before the Effective Date between Tobii and Company.</p>

<p>10.4 Upon request or upon
termination of this Agreement for any reason, the receiving party will return,
destroy, or cause the destruction of any and all records or copies of records
relating to the disclosing party or its business, including Confidential
Information (except for Confidential Information of the disclosing party that
is rightfully contained in the receiving party’s work papers; provided that the
receiving party maintains the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
as required herein), according to the disclosing party’s instructions or
relevant industry best practices if no instructions are provided. Upon
request, the receiving party will certify in writing that all of the disclosing
party’s Confidential Information has been so returned or destroyed.</p>

<h1>APPENDIX A</h1>

<h2>EYE TRACKING DATA TRANSPARENCY POLICY</h2>

<p>If Your Software stores or transfers Eye
Tracking Data, then You must comply with this policy and as such, Tobii 
requires the following to be implemented into Your Software:</p>

<p><b>Active User Acceptance:</b>
Your Software needs to use a consistent format to ask the user, explicitly and
clearly, for their permission to store, or transfer, their Eye Tracking Data. This
request for permission must happen before the user’s data is stored or
transferred. It also needs to state the purpose of storing/transferring Eye
Tracking Data and that such data will not be used for any other purpose.
</p>

<p><b>Visualisation:</b> Your
Software must show the user when the storing or transferring of Eye Tracking
Data is taking place. You must provide a mechanism for visualisation. This is
required unless explicitly waived by Tobii.</p>

<p>Tobii recommends that the following is implemented into Your Software:</p>

<p>The <b>"What’s in it for me"</b> policy: Clearly inform
users about the value they will receive from Your Software. This is about
giving the user clear guidance and motivation about why they should provide
their Eye Tracking Data to You.</p>

<p>Please
note that the implementation of this policy may vary between different
categories of products. For screen-based products, a window, such as the one
below, is recommended for the Active User Acceptance and What’s in it for me
policy.
</p>

<p><img border="0" width="480" height="212" src="./data-transparency-policy.gif"></p>

<h1>Compliance Review</h1>

<p>Compliance with
this Policy is Your responsibility and Tobii has the right to request a
Compliance Review. </p>

<p>Further
information about the policy can be found at <a href="https://transparency.tobii.com/">transparency.tobii.com</a>.
Upon receipt by Tobii of all information requested regarding
Your Software, Tobii will provide You with a response regarding your compliance
with this Policy, in the form of:</p>

<p class="indent1">a) Approval of Your Software and confirmation that it is compliant with this Policy;</p>

<p class="indent1">b) A request to alter Your Software to comply with this Policy; or</p>

<p class="indent1">c) A request for more information.</p>

<p><b>Revoked License</b></p>

<p>If Tobii requests
a Compliance Review of Your Software and You refuse to do so, or Tobii finds
that Your Software does not comply with this Eye Tracking Data Policy and/or
You do not implement the requested changes suggested by Tobii within the agreed
timeframe, then Your license to the Licensed Technology may be immediately
terminated.</p>
