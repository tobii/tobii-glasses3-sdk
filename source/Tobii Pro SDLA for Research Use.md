# APPENDIX A

## EYE TRACKING DATA TRANSPARENCY POLICY

If Your Software stores or transfers Eye Tracking Data, then You must comply with this policy and as such, Tobii requires the following to be implemented into Your Software:

* **Active User Acceptance:** Your Software needs to use a consistent format to ask the user, explicitly and clearly, for their permission to store, or transfer, their Eye Tracking Data. This request for permission must happen before the user’s data is stored or transferred. It also needs to state the purpose of storing/transferring Eye Tracking Data and that such data will not be used for any other purpose.

* **Visualisation:** Your Software must show the user when the storing or transferring of Eye Tracking Data is taking place. You must provide a mechanism for visualisation. This is required unless explicitly waived by Tobii.

Tobii recommends that the following is implemented into Your Software:

* The "**What’s in it for me**" policy: Clearly inform users about the value they will receive from Your  Software. This is about giving the user clear guidance and motivation about why they should provide their Eye Tracking Data to You.

Please note that the implementation of this policy may vary between different categories of products. For screen-based products, a window, such as the one below, is recommended for the Active User Acceptance and What’s in it for me policy.

**Compliance Review**

Compliance with this Policy is Your responsibility and Tobii has the right to request a Compliance Review. Further information about the policy can be found at https://transparency.tobii.com/. Upon receipt by Tobii of all information requested regarding Your Software, Tobii will provide You with a response regarding your compliance with this Policy, in the form of:

a) Approval of Your Software and confirmation that it is compliant with this Policy;

b) A request to alter Your Software to comply with this Policy; or

c) A request for more information.

**Revoked License**

If Tobii requests a Compliance Review of Your Software and You refuse to do so, or Tobii finds that Your Software does not comply with this Eye Tracking Data Policy and/or You do not implement the requested changes suggested by Tobii within the agreed timeframe, then Your license to the Licensed Technology may be immediately terminated.
